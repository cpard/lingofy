 turn data into lingo compatible databases

 - Use [PDM](https://pdm.fming.dev/latest/) to make your life easy.
 - Lingofy turns data stored in Parquet into a database that Lingo can query.
 - You can either pass one parquet file or a directory with many parquet files as parameter.
 - Assumes that each parquet file equals one table.
 - It DOES NOT support all types that Parquet & Lingo support.
 - Use at your own risk :D
